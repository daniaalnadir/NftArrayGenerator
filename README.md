# NFT Array Generator

This repo generates the output of the array for a category of traits which you would otherwise have to manually type.
First it will print you the keys and then it will print the keys and values as an array. 
Then it will print the weightings and give you the right amount of weightings based on the amount of files in the directory you specified.
